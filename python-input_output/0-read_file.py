        filename (str): The path to the file to
        read. Defaults to an empty string.
    Returns:
        None
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.
        PermissionError: If the file cannot be accessed due to permissions.
        OSError: For other issues related to file access.

    Example:
        >>> read_file('my_file.txt')
        (prints the content of 'my_file.txt' to stdout)
